    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I try to pursue other endeavors outside of work. If I don't, I find myself very prone to burnout. When I'm not creating artisanal code, I like to:
    <ul>
      <li>Ferment things. Usually beer, cider, or mead.</li>
      <li>Run - well, I usually hate running while I'm doing it, but I do enjoy having completed the occasional 5k.</li>
      <li>Reading. I'm partial to science fiction (if you are too and haven't read Iain M. Banks yet, you should), but love reading any book where I can learn something new.</li>
      <li>Playing music. I'm far out of practice, but have been revisting the trumpet recently, and hope to learn to play mountain dulcimer in the near future.</li>
    </ul>
