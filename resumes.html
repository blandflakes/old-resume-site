    <h1>Looking for help?</h1>
    <p>I'm always open to discussing new opportunities. I'm especially interested in work that has any combination of the following attributes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Academic or research-support roles</li>
      <li>Interdisciplinary teams</li>
      <li>Back-end/tooling work</li>
      <li>Private/smaller offices or remote work over open office environments</li>
      <li>Uses some of my favorite tech: Clojure, which I've used a fair amount, or Erlang or Rust, which I'd love to learn. Java is fine too.</li>
      <li>A culture of building quality software. Bonus points if engineers are responsible for their own quality and monitoring.</li>
      <li>A culture of work/life balance, especially if there is no on-call.
    </ul>
    <p>I'm open to the idea of contract work or part-time work, but for the moment am employed full-time.</p>
